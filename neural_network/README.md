# Neural Network
My attempt to implement neural network from scratch:
1. Multi-Layer Perceptron
2. Recurrent Neural Network

# Multi-Layer Perceptron
mnist_array_data.tar.gz contains the MNIST data (numpy arrays) that is used in backprop_mnist.py. 
Extract it and put the files ("*.npy") inside src folder before running backprop_mnist.py
