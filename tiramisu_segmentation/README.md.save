Image Segmentation using CNN based on paper titled "The One Hundred Layers Tiramisu: Fully Convolutional DenseNets for Semantic Segmentation" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09326)

Note: Dataset used is CamVid dataset and was not uploaded due to the size. I splitted the dataset into training(450 images), validation(125 images), and test(76 images) sets

Here is the results
