# Image Segmentation Using CRN
Image segmentation using Cascaded Refinement Network. You can find more about CRN here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09405

Note: Dataset used is CamVid dataset and was not uploaded due to the size. I splitted the dataset into training(450 images), validation(125 images), and test(76 images) sets.

This is just a random experiment, but I keep the results here so I can go back to it at some point, and it might be useful for someone who wants to experiment with CRN for image segmentation. I only got 85.16% accuracy on the test set, which is not that impressive. Here is the results:

Note: TensorFlow and PyTorch implementations are coming soon.
