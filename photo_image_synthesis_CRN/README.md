# Photographic Image Synthesis with Cascaded Refinement Networks
Photographic image synthesis from segmentation map based on paper titled "Photographic Image Synthesis with Cascaded Refinement Networks" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09405)

Note: Dataset used is CamVid dataset and was not uploaded due to the size. I splitted the dataset into training(450 images), validation(125 images), and test(76 images) sets.

I have not got the chance to properly train the networks as I am currently working on another big project, but please feel free to clone and play around with it.
